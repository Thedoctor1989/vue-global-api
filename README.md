# vue-global-api

Use Vue Composition API globally

Instead of import APIs from `vue` in every file,

```ts
import { ref, computed, watch } from 'vue'

const counter = ref(0)

const doubled = computed(() => counter.value * 2)

watch(doubled, (v) => {
  console.log('New value: ' + v)
})
```

Now you can directly use them everywhere (with TypeScript support!)

```ts
const counter = ref(0)

const doubled = computed(() => counter.value * 2)

watch(doubled, (v) => {
  console.log('New value: ' + v)
})
```

## Installation

```bash
npm i vue-global-api
```

Then import `vue-global-api` in your main entry to register the global apis 

```ts
// main.js
import 'vue-global-api'
```

And enjoy :)

## Customization

By default, importing `vue-global-api` will register [common composition apis](https://github.com/antfu/vue-global-api/blob/main/scripts/generate.ts) to the global object. If you want to have fine-grain control, use submodule per api:

```ts
// only register `ref` and `computed` as global APIs
import 'vue-global-api/ref'
import 'vue-global-api/computed'
```

## Motivation

In the latest `<script setup>`, compile time macros like `defineProps` and `defineEmits` are now available globally without the need to import them from `vue`. So, as your components are likely to rely on composition APIs like `ref` and `computed`, why don't we just have them available globally as well?
